# Digit Recognition with PyTorch and MNIST

This project focuses on building and training a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset within the PyTorch framework. The goal is to refresh my memory on PyTorch basics and understand how to apply it for practical machine learning tasks.

## Installation

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/penguyen72/mnist.git
   ```

2. Change directory to mnist

   ```bash
   cd mnist
   ```

3. Switching to Python 3.10

   ```bash
   pyenv local 3.10
   ```

4. Create virtual environment

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

5. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Getting Started

Here's how to get started with the application

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Motivation

Refreshing memory on PyTorch with simple project
